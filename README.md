Read the blog post [Presentations with Reveal.js and Vite](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/reveal-vite/)

## Use

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The presentation will run locally at `http://localhost:3000`. You can edit the [index.html](index.html) and [main.js](main.js) to see it auto-reload.

To build the presentation for hosting, run `npm run build`, which creates the `dist` folder.
